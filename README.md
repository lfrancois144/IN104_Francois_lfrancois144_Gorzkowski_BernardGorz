# Hanabi project

This project is for educational purposes: 
its current status should represent the student's starting point.

# Hanabi module

A python3 module that knows Hanabi:

* card deck and dealer,
* CLI (command line interface), lets you play and verifies that your moves are allowed (currently limited to 2 players),
* GUI (to do),
* AI (currently only one, and it is cheating).



## Tasks

There are many possible tasks:

- read the current state of the module, 
  - complete its documentation when needed,
  - share with everyone this improvement,

- improve the CheaterAI
  -- answer the question (still an open question afaik) what is the best possible score, statistically speaking.

- add AIs. Some suggestions:
  - RandomAI (plays randomly)
  - DirectAI (plays whatever is hinted)
  - BGAAI (plays Board Game Arena's standard)
  - HansimAI (see below)
  - train a machine learning (I'm not sure if this will give anything interesting without powerful CPU/GPU resources)
  - design your own, from scratch or by improving another

Keep track of scores for all these games/AI. 
We will want to compare: different AIs on a same deck, or a given AI over a 1000 decks. 
We will need to see why a certain AI fails on a certain game.


- make it workable for up to 5 players.

- make it workable from two separate screens (network?)


During the project:
  - make sure you understand the "replay" mode
  - add tests (UnitTest or whole tests)
  - keep notes on your questions, decisions, discussions (github's wiki)


You may also design a GUI, but be warned that this is a very time-consuming task.
I like PySide2. Tkinter is more portable but harder to learn imho. 



## Installation


    git clone https://github.com/JDGaraudEnsta/hanabi
    cd hanabi
    make        # pip installs it in the default directory ~/.local
    hanabi
    # and now you may play


If `hanabi` doesn't start (`bash: hanabi: command not found`), add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
